- Is how we think of computation
  collapsed:: true
	- Computability theory (1930-1950s)
		- What we can compute
		- e.g. Can we solve problem `x`?
		- e.g. The halting problem
	- Complexity theory (from 1960s)
		- Can we compute `x` efficiently?
- Computers can be categorized (least complex first) based on its computational models, from [[FSM]] (regular language), [[PDA]] (context-free language), [[Turing machine]], [[Undecidable]]
- Languages and finite state automatons (FSM) are actually 2 representations of the same abstract concept
- ## Prerequisites
	- ### [[Language theory]]
		- ToC has roots in linguistics, so the study usually uses linguistics terms
- ## [[FSM]] Finite state automata (or finite state machines)
	- Have no memory
	- FSM can be used to implement [[Regular Expression]] and regular languages
