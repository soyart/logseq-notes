- Is how we think of computation
  collapsed:: true
	- Computability theory (1930-1950s)
		- What we can compute
		- e.g. Can we solve problem `x`?
		- e.g. The halting problem
	- Complexity theory (from 1960s)
		- Can we compute `x` efficiently?
- Computers can be categorized (least complex first) based on its computational models, from [[Finite state automata]] (regular language), [[Push-down automata]] (context-free language), [[Turing machine]], [[Undecidable]]
- Languages and machines are actually 2 representations of the same abstract concept
	- e.g. regular languages can be accepted by [[Finite state automata]]
	- e.g. context free languages can be accepted by [[Push-down automata]]
- ## Prerequisites
	- ### [[Language theory]]
		- ToC has roots in linguistics, so the study usually uses linguistics terms
- ## [[Finite state automata]] (finite state machines)
	- Have no memory
	- [[Finite state automata]] can be used to implement [[Regular Expression]] and regular languages
