# #nix-shell
	- At the core of Nix is nix-shell, which wraps other shell (e.g. bash) with reproducible Nix environment
	- ## Ad-hoc shell
	  id:: 66099b33-641d-42b4-9bcd-1745273827bc
		- We can use nix-shell like other shell, but it comes with package management feature:
		- ```sh
		  # Enter a new shell environment with jq
		  
		  $ nix-shell -p jq
		  ```
		- The shell command above installs `jq` if host system doesn't have one, and returns to a new shell environment with `jq`
		- Note that `jq` is not installed to your host system. It was only downloaded to nixstore and linked to some paths that allows it to be used in the nix-shell session
		- You can use `--run <shell_cmd>` to immediately execute a command in nix-shell without having to manually enter and exit the environment.
		- ```sh
		  # Use the new shell (with bat and ripgrep) and runs 'bat ... | ripgrep ..'
		  
		  $ nix-shell -p bat ripgrep --run bat 'foo.txt' | ripgrep 'bar'
		  ```
		- We can specify exactly what will be available in the nix-shell environment, and even specify package versions explicitly with `-I`:
		- ```sh
		  # Enter a new shell, with specific git package (-I),
		  # Flag `--` pure also discards most current envs
		  # set on the system when running the command.
		  
		  $ nix-shell \
		  	-p git\                # Package(s) to include
		      --run "git --version"\ # Command to run
		      --pure\                # Discard most of host environment
		      -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/2a601aafdc5605a5133a2ca506a34a3a73377247.tar.gz
		      
		  # git version: 2.33.1
		  ```
	- ## Reproducible script
		- Let's say we have a normal shell script:
			- ```sh
			  #! /usr/bin/env bash
			  
			  curl https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/releases.atom | xml2json | jq .
			  ```
			- This script has some pitfalls - it assumes the host has `curl`, `xml2json`, and `jq` installed
			- To fix that, we can make use of `nix-shell` compatibility with UNIX shebang:
			- ```sh
			  #!/usr/bin/env nix-shell
			  #! nix-shell -i bash --pure
			  #! nix-shell -p bash cacert curl jq python3Packages.xmljson
			  #! nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/2a601aafdc5605a5133a2ca506a34a3a73377247.tar.gz
			  
			  # Note The command `xml2json` is provided by the package
			  # `python3Packages.xmljson`
			  
			  curl https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/releases.atom | xml2json | jq .
			  ```
			- `-i` defines the program to be used as interpreter of this script file
			- `-I` refers to a specific Git commit of the Nixpkgs repository. Explore packages at https://search.nixos.org
			- This means that the `nix-shell`-enabled version of script will always execute with the same package versions, everywhere, and the host system's environment will not pollute the script's executing
	- ## Declarative shell
		- Unlike [ad-hoc shell](((66099b33-641d-42b4-9bcd-1745273827bc))), which is great for running a command quickly but not permanently, Nix also allows us to compose/declare specification for shells.
		- If ad-hoc shell is "reproducible" command execution, declarative shell is instead a reproducible and mostly persistent shell environment
		- We declare the shell in a Nix file `shell.nix`. Sharing this Nix file allows everyone to reproduce our shell environment.
		- By default, nix-shell looks for `shell.nix` at CWD, and builds a new shell based on expression in that file
		- ### Quick intro to `shell.nix`
			- Let's create a simple Nix file for our declarative shell `shell.nix`:
			- ```nix
			  # File shell.nix
			  
			  let
			  
			    # We use a version of Nixpkgs pinned to a release branch,
			    # and explicitly set configuration options and overlays to
			    # avoid them being inadvertently overridden by global configuration.
			    
			    nixpkgs = fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tarball/nixos-23.11";
			    pkgs = import nixpkgs { config = {}; overlays = []; };
			  in
			  
			  # mkShellNoCC is a function that produces such an environment,
			  # but without a compiler toolchain.
			  
			  pkgs.mkShellNoCC {
			    packages = with pkgs; [
			      cowsay
			      lolcat
			    ];
			    
			    # Set environment in mkShellNoCC
			    SOME_ENV = "FOONIX";
			  }
			  ```
			- We can use `shellHook` to run a command before entering the interactive shell of our `shell.nix` environment:
			- ```nix
			  let
			   	nixpkgs = fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tarball/nixos-23.11";
			  	pkgs = import nixpkgs { config = {}; overlays = []; };
			  in
			  
			  pkgs.mkShellNoCC {
			   	packages = with pkgs; [
			  		cowsay
			  		lolcat
			  	];
			  
			  	GREETING = "Hello, Nix!";
			  
			  	shellHook = ''
			  	echo $GREETING | cowsay | lolcat
			  	'';
			  }
			  ```
		- ### Pinning Nixpkgs
			- Sometimes we may see the following:
			- ```nix
			  { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}
			  
			  }:
			  
			  {
			  	# Some expression
			  }
			  ```
			- Here, `<nixpkgs>` are used to represent "some" Nix packages
			- However, using`<nixpkgs>` are not reproducible, because we did not pinpoint the exact version of Nixpkgs
			- The simplest way to pin Nixpkgs s to fetch the required Nixpkgs version as a tarball specified via the relevant Git commit hash:
			- ```nix
			  { pkgs ? import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/06278c77b5d162e62df170fec307e83f1812d94b.tar.gz") {}
			  
			  }:
			  
			  {
			  	# Some expression
			  }
			  ```
			- Normally, we pick Nixpkgs from the following sources:
				- Stable Nixpkgs, e.g. `nixos-21.05`, `nixos-23.11`, etc.
				- `nixos-unstable`
- ## Nix language
