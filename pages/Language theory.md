- ## Alphabet $\Sigma$
  collapsed:: true
	- A set of symbols
	- e.g. $\Sigma_\text{A} = \{a, b, c, \dots, z\}$ is *alphabet* over lowercase Latin characters
	- e.g. $\Sigma_\text{B} = \{0, 1\}$ is *binary alphabets* named B, whose elements can only be symbols `0` or `1`
- ## Symbol
  collapsed:: true
	- e.g. the individual `a`, `b`, `c`, `0`, `1`
- ## Powers of Sigma Σ
  collapsed:: true
	- $\Sigma^n$ is the set of strings of length `n`
	- e.g. the language has this alphabets: $\Sigma = {0, 1}$
		- $\Sigma^0$ -> All strings of length 0 -> $Σ^0 = \Epsilon = \{ε\}$
		- $\Sigma^1$ -> All strings of length 1 -> $\Sigma^1 = \{0, 1\}$
		- $\Sigma^2$ -> All strings of length 2 -> $\Sigma^2 = \{00, 01, 10, 11\}$
	- #### Cardinality = Σ^n
		- Number of elements in a set
		- e.g. if the language has this alphabet set $\Sigma = {0, 1}$
		  collapsed:: true
			- Then cardinality is 2^n (Σ has 2 elements)
	- #### $\Sigma^\ast$ and $\Sigma^+$  (assume alphabets $\Sigma = {0, 1}$)
		- Sets of all possible strings over `{0, 1}`
		- $\Sigma^\ast = \Sigma^0 \cup \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2 \cup \Sigma^3 \cup \dots \cup \Sigma^n$
		- $\Sigma^\ast = \Epsilon ∪ \{0, 1\} ∪ \{00, 01, 10, 11\} ∪ \{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, ...\}$
		- $\Sigma^+$ is like $\Sigma^\ast$, but without $\Epsilon$
- ## String
  collapsed:: true
	- Sequence over a set of symbols
	- An empty string is an Epsilon ε
	- e.g. we have symbols `0` and `1`, then `0011010` is a string
	- e.g. If alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$, then `011101` is a string of legal alphabets `0` and `1`
- ## Language
  id:: eb18ac5c-b11f-4447-833f-aa748e9c88f6
	- A *formal* language is a set of strings that can be described using *formal* grammar
	- Regular language examples
		- > These examples will express language from [[Regular Expression]], that is, we write $$A = L(R)$$ to build language $A$ from regex $R$
		- $\Sigma_\text{simbin} = \{0, 1\}$
		- e.g. Language $L_1$ accepts any strings with alphabet $\Sigma_{simbin}$
			- $L_1 = L(\{\Sigma_{simbin}^+\})$
			- Then strings `0`, `1`, and `101011` are valid $L_1$ strings
			- Strings `02`, `a10` are not valid strings for $L_1$
		- e.g. Language $L_2$ accepts any strings over $\Sigma_\text{simbin}$ **of exact length 2**
			- $L_2 = L(\{\Sigma_{simbin}\Sigma_{simbin}\})$
			- Then strings `00`, `01`, `10`, `11` are valid Simbin2 strings
			- But `0`, `100`, `12` are not valid $L_2$ strings
		- e.g. Language $L_3$ language accepts any strings over $\Sigma_\text{simbin}$ that starts with symbol `0`
			- $L_3 = L(\{0\circ\Sigma_{simbin}^\ast\})$
			- Then `0110`, `011111`, `0` are valid $L_3$ strings
		- From examples $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, only $L_2$  have finite sets of valid strings.
	- ### Regular languages
		- Can be recognized by a finite state machine [[Finite state automata]] (e.g. a [[DFA]] or [[NFA]])
		- Can be described by [[Regular Expression]]
		- Will pass regular pumping lemma
	- ### Context-free languages [[CFL]]
		- Can be described by a context-free grammar [[CFG]]
		- Will pass context-free pumping lemma
- ## Pumping lemma
	- > A test for languages **if it's not** regular or context-free: i.e. regular pumping lemma cannot prove if a language is regular - it can only be used to prove that it's not regular
	- ### Regular pumping lemma
		- #### Lemma
			- If language $A$ is regular, then $A$ has a pumping length $P$ such that any string $S$ where $\vert S \vert \geq P$ maybe divided into 3 parts $S = x\circ y\circ z$ such that the following conditions are true
			- $x\circ y^i\circ z \in A$ \forall $i \geq 0$
			- $\vert y \vert \gt 0$
			- $\vert x \circ y \vert \leq P$
		- #### Concept
			- The lemma says that regular language $A$ has some constant value $P$ associated with it
			- The lemma says that, we can get a large string $S \mid S\in A$ chopped into 3 parts, $x\circ y\circ z$
			- Note that $y$ must comes after $x$, and the length of $x\circ y$ must not exceed $P$
			- So $y$ is actually a middle part of $S$, and if $\vert S\vert$ is very large compared to $P$, then $y$ would be a bit further to the left
			- The pumping lemma says that, if we pump $y \mapsto y^i$, then $x\circ y^i\circ z$ is still $\in A$
			- This means that, if $A$ is regular, then we can pump $y$ however we want, and the resulting string must still be $\in A$
