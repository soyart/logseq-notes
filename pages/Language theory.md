- ## Symbol
	- The most basic unit of languages
	- e.g. the individual `a`, `b`, `c`, `0`, `1`
	- To be grouped in a set called alphabets, and are used to form strings
- ## Alphabet $\Sigma$
	- A set of symbols
	- e.g. $\Sigma_\text{B} = \{0, 1\}$ is binary alphabet named B, whose elements can only be symbols $0$ or $1$
	- e.g. $\Sigma_{Decimals} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9\}$ is alphabet over Arabic numerals $0$ to $1$
	- e.g. $\Sigma_\text{Lower} = \{a, b, c, \dots, z\}$ is alphabet over lowercase Latin characters
	- e.g. $\Sigma_\text{Upper} = \{A, B, C, \dots, Z\}$ is alphabet over uppercase Latin characters
	- e.g. $\Sigma_{Latin} = \Sigma_{Lower} \cup \Sigma_{Upper}$
	- e.g. $\Sigma_{English} = \{., ?\} \cup \Sigma_{Latin} \cup \Sigma_{Decimals}$ is alphabet for modern English language, which include Latin alphabets in all cases, Arabic numerals, and the full stop and question mark.
	- #### Cardinality $\vert\Sigma\vert$
		- Number of elements in an alphabet set
		- e.g. if $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
			- Then cardinality is $\vert\{0, 1\}\vert$ = 2 (Σ has 2 elements)
- ## Powers of Sigma $\Sigma^n$
	- $$\vert\Sigma^n\vert = {\vert\Sigma\vert}^n$$
	- $\Sigma^n$ is the set of strings of over $\Sigma$ of length $n$
	- e.g. if $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$
		- $\Sigma^0$ -> All strings of length 0 -> $Σ^0 = \Epsilon = \{\epsilon\}$
		- $\Sigma^1$ -> All strings of length 1 -> $\Sigma^1 = \{0, 1\}$
			- $\Sigma^1 = {\Sigma} = \{\{0, 1\}\}$
		- $\Sigma^2$ -> All strings of length 2 -> $\Sigma^2 = \{00, 01, 10, 11\}$
			- $\Sigma^2 = \{\Sigma,\Sigma\} = \{\{0, 1\}, \{0, 1\}\}$
	- #### $\Sigma^\ast$ and $\Sigma^+$  (assume alphabets $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$)
		- Sets of all possible strings over symbols $0$ and $1$
		- $\Sigma^\ast = \Sigma^0 \cup \Sigma^1 \cup \Sigma^2 \cup \Sigma^3 \cup \dots \cup \Sigma^n$
		- $\Sigma^\ast = \Epsilon ∪ \{0, 1\} ∪ \{00, 01, 10, 11\} ∪ \{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, ...\}$
		- $\Sigma^+$ is like $\Sigma^\ast$, but without $\Epsilon$, so it cannot contain empty string $\epsilon$
- ## String
	- Sequence of symbols
	- Languages will specify alphabet, and rules to expand them into valid strings
	- Valid strings are formed only from accepted alphabet and rules
	- An empty string is an Epsilon ε
	- e.g. If $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$, then `011101` is a legal string for this alphabet
	- e.g. If $\Sigma = \{a, b, c, \dots, z\}$, then `art`, `hrr`, `kyt` are valid strings for this alphabet
- ## Formal languages
  id:: eb18ac5c-b11f-4447-833f-aa748e9c88f6
	- A *formal* language is a set of strings that can be described using *formal* grammar
	- Regular language examples
		- > These examples will express language from [[Regular expression]], that is, we write $$A = L(R)$$ to build language $A$ from regex $R$
		- Alphabet $\Sigma_\text{simbin} = \{0, 1\}$
		- e.g. Language $L_1$ accepts any strings with alphabet $\Sigma_{simbin}$
			- $L_1 = L(\{\Sigma_{simbin}^+\})$
			- Then strings `0`, `1`, and `101011` are valid $L_1$ strings
			- Empty string $\epsilon$ is not valid string for $L_1$
				- If we want $L_1$ to accept empty string, then we should describe it as $L_1 = \{\Sigma^\ast\}$
			- Strings `02`, `a10` are not valid strings for $L_1$
		- e.g. Language $L_2$ accepts any strings over $\Sigma_\text{simbin}$ **of exact length 2**
			- $L_2 = L(\{\Sigma_{simbin}\Sigma_{simbin}\})$
			- Then strings `00`, `01`, `10`, `11` are valid Simbin2 strings
			- But `0`, `100`, `12` are not valid $L_2$ strings
		- e.g. Language $L_3$ language accepts any strings over $\Sigma_\text{simbin}$ that starts with symbol `0`
			- $L_3 = L(\{0\circ\Sigma_{simbin}^+\})$
			- Then `0110`, `011111` are valid $L_3$ strings
			- But `0` is not, because $\Sigma^+$ is not matched
				- If we want $L_3$ to additionally accept `0` (a `zero` followed by empty string), then we should describe it as $L_3 = \{0\circ\Sigma^\ast\}$
		- From examples $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, only $L_2$  have finite sets of valid strings.
	- ### Regular languages
		- Can be recognized by a finite state machine [[Finite state automata]] (e.g. a [[DFA]] or [[NFA]])
		- Can be described by [[Regular expression]]
		- Will pass regular pumping lemma
	- ### Context-free languages
		- Can be recognized by a [[Push-down automata]]
		- Can be described by a context-free grammar [[Context-free grammar]]
		- Will pass context-free pumping lemma
- ## Pumping lemma
	- The pumping lemma is usually used to prove that a language is not regular *by contradiction*
	- ### Regular pumping lemma
		- #### Lemma
			- > If language $A$ is regular, then $A$ has a pumping length $p$ such that any string $S$ where $\vert S \vert \geq p$ maybe divided into 3 parts $S = x\circ y\circ z$ such that the following conditions are true:
			- $\vert y \vert \geq 1$
			- $\vert xy \vert \leq p$
			- $(\forall i \geq 0)({x}y^{i}z \in A)$
		- #### Concept
			- > If $\vert{S}\vert$ is very large and language $A$ is regular, then the [[Finite state automata]] that recognizes $A$ must repeat itself on some states in order to land at accepted states.
			- The lemma says that regular language $A$ has some constant value $p$ associated with it
			- The lemma says that, we can get a large string $S \mid S\in A$ chopped into 3 parts, $x\circ y\circ z$
			- Note that $y$ must comes after $x$, and the length of $x\circ y$ must not exceed $p$
			- So $y$ is actually a middle part of $S$, and if $\vert S\vert$ is very large compared to $p$, then $y$ would be a bit further to the left
			- The pumping lemma says that, if we pump $y \mapsto y^i$, then $x\circ y^i\circ z$ is still $\in A$
			- This means that, if $A$ is regular, then we can pump $y$ however we want, and the resulting string must still be $\in A$
			- The pumping length $p$ is greater than the number of an [[Finite state automata]] that recognizes the regular language
		- #### Proof examples
			- Remember, it's a proof by contradiction, so we at first always assume test language to be regular.
			- Each example may have multiple proofs
			- #### $A_1 = L(\{a^{k}b^k \mid k \geq 0\})$
				- > $A_1$ is language of any strings with equal number of symbols $a$ and $b$
				- $p = 8$
					- Case 1: $x$ and $y$ is in the `a` part, while $z$ is strictly a string of `b`s
						- Let's assign $k = p \implies k = 8$
						- $S = a^8b^8$ = `aaaaaaaabbbbbbbb`
						- $x$ = `aa`
						- $y$ = `aaaaaa`
						- $b$ = `bbbbbbbb`
						- $S_{pump} = xy^{3}z = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbb$
						- $S_{pump} \notin A_1$ because $S_{pump}$ has different numbers of `a`s and `b`s
					- Case 2: $x$ is in `a` part, $y$ has both `a` and `b`, and $z$ has `b` only
						- Let's say $S$ is super long, so we can liberally assign $y$
						- $k = 100 \implies S = a^{100}b^{100}$
						- We want $x$ to be in `a`-only part, $y$ to have both `a` and `b`, and $z$ to only contain `b`
							- In other words, $x = \{a^\ast\}$, $y= \{\{a,b\}^\ast\}$, and $z = \{b^\ast\}$
						- But we can't divide $S = xyz$ such that $y$ has some `b` and satisfies $\vert{xy}\vert \leq p$
						- So $A_1$ is not regular
			- #### $A_2 = L(\{yy \mid y \in \{0, 1\}^\ast\})$
			  id:: 65a173fb-af9f-49f8-9269-c92c2df58776
				- > $A_2$ is a language whose strings has 2 identical parts, i.e. the first half is identical to the second half. Or $L(S) = A$ and $S = 0101 = yy \implies y = 01$
				  
				  > We can clearly see that, since [[Finite state automata]] has no memory, it can't remember what the first half was, and thus is unable to recognize $A_2$.
				- $p=7$ and $S = 0^p1\circ0^p1 = 0000000100000001$
					- $x = 0^2 = 00$
					- $y = 0^4 = 0000$
					- $z = 01\circ0^71 = 0100000001$
					- Pump $y \mapsto y^2 \implies S_{pump} = xy^2z$
					- $S_{pump} = 00000000000100000001$
					- $S_{pump} \notin A_2$
		- #### Caveats
			- $A = L(\{w \mid w$ has equal numbers of 0 and 1 $\})$ is *not regular*
			- $B = L(\{w \mid w$ has equal numbers of 01 and 10 $\})$ is *regular*!
			- $C = L(\{ww \mid w \in \Sigma^\ast\})$ is *not regular*
				- This is similar to one of the [previous proof example](((65a173fb-af9f-49f8-9269-c92c2df58776)))
				- If we prove with $S = 0^p0^p$, then we might fool ourselves thinking $C$ is regular because it can be pumped and stay $\in C$
				- But if we choose $S = 0^p10^p1$, then we can prove that $C$ is not regular
