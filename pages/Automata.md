- # Finite state automata (finite state machines)
	- > A machine with finite states
	- Set of all states `Q`
		- Initial state `q1`
	- Set of all inputs `Σ`
	- ## [[DFA]]
		- Deterministic and very simple
		- Can have many final states, but only 1 initial states
		- **No outputs**
		- All states mush have known path given inputs, including the **dead** or **trap** states
		  collapsed:: true
			- `Q x Σ -> Q`
		- Can be minimized (less states)
	- ## [[NFA]]
		- Not that deterministic (but still has **finite states**)
		- **No outputs**
		- A state + input can lead to >1 states
		- Can have many final states, but only 1 initial states
		- The transition function maps Q and Σ to 2^Q
			- `Q x Σ -> 2^Q`
			- e.g. if `Q = [A, B, C]` then possible transitions are `[A, B, C, AA, AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC]`
		- Phi `Φ` means the transition will not happen (not to be confused with epsilon `ε`)
		- Not to be confused with [[Epsilon-NFA]]
		- Can be converted into [[DFA]] - the resulting DFA may have more states than the original NFA
		- To solve complex problems, we can first design a NFA, and then convert it into [[DFA]], before finally minimizing the DFA.
	- ## [[Epsilon-NFA]]
		- Epsilon `ε` is empty string input
		- The formal definition is the same for normal [[NFA]], **excepts the transition function maps `Q x Σ ∪ ε -> 2^Q`**
		- Every state that gets Epsilon goes to itself including `q0` and final states
		- Can be converted to NFA with Epsilon closures
		- ### Epsilon closure `ε*`
			- All states that can be reached by only seeing Epsilon `ε`
	- ## [[Moore machines]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Have outputs associated with states
		- Can be converted into [[Mealy machines]]
	- ## [[Mealy machines]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Have outputs associated with *transition*
		- Mealy conversion to [[Moore machines]] will result in more states in the target Moore machines
		  collapsed:: true
			- Let's say Mealy has `x` number of states, and `y` number of outputs
			- The resulting Moore could have `x*y` number of states and the same `y` number of outputs
			- The resulting Moore will not have output associated with its initial states
