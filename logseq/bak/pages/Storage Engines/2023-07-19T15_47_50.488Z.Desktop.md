- Data structures that power our databases with data storage and retrieval (writes and queries) on a single machine
	- [Log-based (LSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)
		- Stores data in long sequence of changes (logs)
		- Logs are separated into segments
		- Segments are periodically merged and compacted
		- �
			- �🏼
		- Append-only, unsorted logs
		  collapsed:: true
			- Use append-only log files, in segments
			- Log files are usually in binary
			- Older segments can be compacted (merged)
			- More recent logs take precedence
			- Indexing can be used to speed up reads
			  collapsed:: true
				- Hash index
				  collapsed:: true
					- Index is a hash map of keys and entry locations
					- How it works:
					  collapsed:: true
						- We keep an index for every segment file
						- Read from current index, if not found, then from older segment's index
						- When current segment file got too large, switch writes to new segment files
						  collapsed:: true
							- Merge/compact old segment files
							- Build new index for merged segment files and delete the old segments
					- Limitations:
					  collapsed:: true
						- Memory: Large key size = large memory used for indexing
						- Runtime: ranged queries (i.e. from `foo001` -> `foo002`) will take O(n)
		- SortedStringTree (SSTree)
		  collapsed:: true
			- Keys are sorted alphabetically in segmented log files
			  collapsed:: true
				- To do this, we need a structure that we can append in any order and read them back correctly in sorted order
				- This can be done in-memory (*memtable*) or on-disk
			- We still need an in-memory hash index of compressed segment key and their location, called *Sparse Index*
			- Using self-balancing tree write cache (memtable) before committing to SSTable segment files on-disk is called **LSM**.
			- How it works:
				- When writes come in, write to *memtable*, which is an in-memory self-balancing tree
				- After *memtable* got too big, dump it to new SSTable segment files
				- When reads come in, read from *memtable* first, if not found then read from *sparse indexes* of more recent segment files
				- Periodically run merge and compaction tasks on segment files, while accepting writes to memtable
				- To prevent data loss during crash when new changes only appear in *memtable*, most DBs maintain a separate list of unsorted logs. After the SSTable's been successfully dumped, remove this accompanying log.
			- Benefits:
				- Smaller size of indexes compared to hash index (each sorted index key points to a range of records, vs 1-1 mapping in hash indexes)
				- More efficient read queries compared to hash index
			- Limitations:
				- Reading for nonexistent keys can be expensive as the DB will have to go through all contents of memtable and SSTable segments. This can be remedied with *Bloom filters*, which efficiently tells us whether the key existed
	- Page-based
		- B-Tree (on-disk) or
			- Treats underlying storages as *pages*, i.e. a disk's 4K block is used as a page.
			- Each page represent a node in the B-Tree
