- # [[Kubernetes]] setup
	- ## Production
		- In production, we usually have many [[k8s node]]s, with >1 [[k8s Master node]]s
		- They run on cloud platforms, or other specialized environment
	- ## Development/test environment
		- In development, devs usually just run the [[k8s Cluster]] on 1 [[k8s node]]
		- We usually use FOSS tools to run the cluster on our local machine
			- [[minikube]]
				- Lightweight and user-friendly
				- Only support 1 [[k8s node]]
				- Run the node as either a [[Docker Container]], VM, or bare-metal
			- [[k3s]]
				- Lightweight and production grade
				- Supports multiple [[k8s node]]s
			- [[k3d]] wraps  [[k3s]] in [[Docker Container]]
			- [[kind]] Kubernetes in Docker.
				- Supports multiple [[k8s node]]s
				- Each node is a Docker container (container-ception)
			- [[microk8s]]
				- Support multiple [[k8s node]]s
